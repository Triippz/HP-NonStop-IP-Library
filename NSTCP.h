*		Purpose:	This library is geared towards TCP/IP operations within
*					NonStop Guardian enviornments. Some of the code may need to be
*					tweaked, as this was geared towards compilation on a C++ compiler.
*					
*		Notes:		When utilizing this library, please bear in mind, except for 
*					initialization, you will be operating through the TCP structure
*					when making calls. It is similar to working with object-based code.
